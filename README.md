TurnCal offers a digital solution for planing shifts, calculates salaries and economical administration.
It is an app that gives the user an easy way to administrate work shifts and salaries. This is done through a calendar with an automatic calculation of salary.
There will also be an administration app that can control many userapps for the owner of a business.

This is only a way to learn while I am looking for work, so this will likely not be finished.

If it goes far, this will be an ios and android app. While the admin app will be a windows program.

So far I have just tested it in windows with C# and SQL.
